# NovaEdge-Marketing-Campaign-Analysis

## Project Overview
NovaEdge has been running multiple marketing campaigns across various channels (Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest) to promote our products. We have collected detailed data on daily ad performance, including metrics like impressions, clicks, spend, conversions, and engagement (likes, shares, comments). This project aims to analyze this data to gain insights into the effectiveness of our campaigns, optimize our ad spend, and improve future marketing strategies.

## Problem Statement
NovaEdge wants to optimize its marketing campaigns by analyzing past performance data. However, without a clear understanding of the factors contributing to campaign success, the company risks inefficient budget allocation and missed opportunities for growth. This project seeks to evaluate campaign data to identify key performance drivers, maximize the effectiveness of ViralByte’s advertising budget, and refine future marketing strategies for improved engagement and ROI.

## Aim and Objectives
## Aim
This project aims to analyze this data to gain insights into the effectiveness of our campaigns, optimize our ad spend, and improve future marketing strategies.

- Calculate the return on investment (ROI) for each campaign.
- Track the performance trends over time to identify patterns and seasonal effects.

## Data Cleaning
I checked the dataset for duplicates, inconsistencies, missing values, and also the format of the data. I changed the datatype of the columns with incorrect data format using ALTER function. I rounded some numerical columns to 2 decimal places using ROUND functions.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
I analysed Key Marketing Metrics like ad performance, channel effectiveness, campaign performance, and ROI generated to provide insights on how to optimize ad spend and improve marketing strategies. 
My approach involved breaking down business questions into structured queries. I used aggregate functions to perform calculations, date functions to extract month and month name from the date, cast function to round up decimal value. I filtered and sorted the data where necessary using HAVING and ORDER BY functions to generate meaningful insights.

## Key Business Questions
